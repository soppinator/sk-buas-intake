INTRODUCTION:
The game I made was inspired by Flappy Bird and uses the C++ template provided and pixel collision detection by CroakingKero.
Instead of making a 1:1 copy of Flappy Bird, I wanted to use only the concept as a jumping off point.
The game includes a welcome screen, difficulty selection screen, gameplay with different speeds and a score, and a game over screen.
The art and animation was done completely by me, using Krita as a drawing program.

There are 3 difficulties which affect the gameplay in different ways.
EASY:
- Bird is a Chickadee
- Game speed is slow
- Being in a cloud only temporarily halves the speed
MEDIUM:
- Bird is a Puffin
- Game speed is faster
- Being in a cloud temporarily halves the speed AND removes 2 points
HARD:
- Bird is an Osprey
- Game speed is very fast
- Hitting a cloud ends the game

IN ALL DIFFICULTIES:
- Hitting a tree ends the game
- Successfully flying over a tree adds a point

INSTALLATION:
Install the same way as the template; 
- extract zip into new folder/folder of choice,
- open the .sln folder,
- hit F5 to run.

CONTROLS:
Controls are displayed on screen when contextually relevant, but here is a guide just in case:
S - START/CONFIRM/RESTART
1 / 2 / 3 - SELECT BIRD (DURING BIRD SELECTION)
SPACE - FLAP/FLY UP
R - RE-SELECT BIRD (AFTER GAME OVER)
P - PAUSE
ESC - EXIT
